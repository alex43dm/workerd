== PHP EXTENSION ==

sudo make php_ext 

(sudo is needed because it will try and install in php extension dir.)

== C Library ==

make libredis

(which will leave 'libredis.so' in the lib dir)

== Multithreading support ==

Multithreading support is enabled by default. In case libredis is never used
concurrently by multiple threads, it is possible to disable it by setting the
environmental variable SINGLETHREADED=1 when running make. This can result in
better performance by making the library not thread-safe.

enjoy.
